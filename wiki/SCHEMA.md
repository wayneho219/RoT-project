# Wiki Schema

This file is the configuration for this wiki. It documents the conventions, page types, tag taxonomy, and any workflow customizations. The LLM reads this first when entering the wiki, and its conventions override the defaults documented in the `llm-wiki` skill.

This file is **co-evolved with the user**. When the LLM notices a recurring pattern in your edits or feedback that isn't here, it will propose adding it. When something here stops fitting, prune it.

## Wiki location

- Wiki root: `wiki/`
- Raw sources: `raw/`
- Asset/image storage: `raw/assets/`

## Page types

This wiki uses these page types, each with a dedicated subdirectory:

- `source` (in `wiki/sources/`) — one summary page per ingested source.
- `entity` (in `wiki/entities/`) — pages about specific things: people, papers, products, places, organizations.
- `concept` (in `wiki/concepts/`) — pages about ideas, methods, frameworks, abstractions.
- `synthesis` (in `wiki/synthesis/`) — cross-cutting analyses, comparisons, query answers filed back.

Add additional types here as the wiki evolves.

## Tag taxonomy

(Empty initially. Add tags here as you adopt them, with one-line descriptions. Keep this list small and disciplined — a wiki with 200 tags has effectively no tags.)

Example structure:
- `methodology` — pages about research or analytical methods.
- `open-question` — pages or sections that flag unresolved questions.
- `contested` — pages where sources contradict.

## Page sizing

- Soft cap: 400 lines / ~2,000 words. Consider splitting beyond this.
- Hard cap: 800 lines. Must split.

## Frontmatter requirements

Every page must have:
- `type`
- `title`
- `tags`
- `created`
- `updated`

Plus type-specific:
- `source` pages: `authors`, `url` (if applicable), `raw`, `ingested`
- Non-source pages: `sources` listing the source-summary pages drawn from

## Optional graph metadata

Pages may declare typed graph metadata under a top-level `graph:` key. This is the source of truth for the compiled knowledge graph under `wiki/graph/`. Markdown remains canonical; the graph is a regenerable index. Pages without `graph:` still appear as nodes (derived from `type`/`kind`) and still contribute `mentions` edges from body `[[wikilinks]]`.

```yaml
graph:
  node_id: person:praney-behl       # optional; default <node_type>:<slug>
  node_type: person                  # optional; default mapped from type/kind via ontology
  canonical: true                    # mark as canonical when multiple slugs alias the same entity
  aliases: [Praney, praney@example.com]
  relationships:
    - predicate: founded
      object: company:seedblocks
      source: praney-founder-context-dump   # source-page slug
      evidence: "Solo technical founder and sole director..."
      confidence: high               # high | medium | low
      status: current                # current | historical | proposed | disputed | superseded
      # optional:
      # valid_from: 2025-01-15
      # valid_to: 2026-03-01
      # notes: "..."
      # raw_ref: "raw/founder-dump.md#L42"
      # contradicts: edge-id-or-source-slug
      # supersedes: edge-id-or-source-slug
```

Required fields on every relationship: `predicate`, `object`, `source`, `evidence`, `confidence`, `status`. Predicates and the subject/object types they accept are declared in `wiki/graph/ontology.yaml`. Typed semantic edges must be supported by an explicit source — never emit one inferred from training data alone.

## Index structure

(Update this section when sharding.)

Currently flat: a single `wiki/index.md` listing all pages.

When the wiki passes ~150 pages or `index.md` exceeds 300 lines, shard into `wiki/indexes/<type>.md` and update this section.

## Graph layer

The wiki has an optional compiled graph layer under `wiki/graph/`:

- `wiki/graph/ontology.yaml` — declares node types and predicates. **Tracked.** Edit this when you introduce new predicates or domain types.
- `wiki/graph/nodes.jsonl`, `wiki/graph/edges.jsonl` — generated. Track in git only if you want graph diffs in PRs.
- `wiki/graph/graph.sqlite` — generated. Gitignored by default.
- `wiki/graph/graph.graphml` — generated. Track only if you want to diff it.

Generation is reproducible from markdown via `scripts/wiki_graph_extract.py`. The graph can be deleted at any time and rebuilt without losing knowledge — markdown is canonical.

## Workflow customizations

(Empty initially. Document any deviations from the default ingest/query/lint workflows here.)

## User preferences

- **語言**：所有 wiki 頁面一律使用繁體中文撰寫（標題、內文、標籤說明）。英文專有名詞保留原文，第一次出現時附上中文說明。
- **比較表格**：概念頁面優先使用表格呈現對比（如 LLM Wiki vs RAG）。
- **一句話定義**：每個概念頁面開頭需有「一句話定義」段落。

## Lint cadence

- Structural lint: after every 5 ingests.
- Semantic lint: weekly or after every 20 ingests.
- Gap-finding: monthly.
- Graph lint + extract: after every ingest that adds typed `graph.relationships`.

Adjust based on the wiki's growth rate.
